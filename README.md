# The First Step.

qbot is a bot coded with noblox.js and discord.js that communicates with Roblox with Discord triggers. Basically, there are many commands you can type in Discord and it will send that request to your group. For example, setting a user's group rank.

Below is an FAQ that will most likely answer all questions you have.

## Does it require coding knowledge?

If you follow these basic instructions, you should be able to do this without much coding knowledge.

## Does it take long?

Nope. You can use this template and make a bot in under 15 minutes if you are used to this. If you are new to this, it may take longer though. I'd say a maximum of 30 minutes if you are new.

## Do I need to pay for this?

No, this bot template does not cost money to use. It is completely free to use and no attribution is required. However, you can not claim that you created this bot, if someone asks you should tell the truth.
